                <h1>Essay 1</h1>
                <p>Experiences that have different impact on our lives are created by designers and developers. Some of the most important components that structure these encounters are User Interface and User Experience. They influence how we navigate, engage, and get value from a website. With the task at hand being to delve into the ethical considerations of a South African website, I have chosen to look at News24, one of the most prominent distributors of the country’s news.</p> 

                <p>Before starting the assignment, my mind had mostly been set on using retail websites for this task. I think mainly because they’re the most commonly used websites. I strayed away from this and went with News24. According to a recently published article by MyBroadband, another prominent news website, News24, was one of the most visited websites in the 2023 calendar year, placing 10th (My Broadband, 2024). It was also, interestingly enough, one of the only local websites on there, painting an even broader picture of the dominance of external entities within the country's ecosystem. In my analysis, I will mainly focus on the design of the site adjacent to the UI and UX, scrutinizing it against industry standards and critical perspectives. Moreover, I will deliberate on the ethical implications, considering the issues within them. I will also try my best to avoid the site's main content, the news, to form an unbiased critique of this. </p>
                
                <p>As I’ve already mentioned, News24 is one of the main sources of current events regarding the ongoing events in South Africa. They’re owned by Media24 and have articles that fall within a great multitude of categories. These range from politics, sports, cultural events, and entertainment to finance, technology, and health. The first thing I did was relate this website to Jorge Borges’ Library of Babel. The quest for meaning and truth closely relates to the design process of creating interfaces that guide users to relevant information (Borges, 1941). Similarly, the News24 website aims to provide users with access to current events and stories that align with their quest for knowledge and understanding. The range of their coverage is certainly influential, making them one of the most popular sites. On launching the website, you are greeted by the homepage. The first thing I noticed were the articles. There are multiple showcases on there, all within different categories, with the most visible one, however, taking up the most real estate. I also assume that this article will be different based on your location because, in my case, it was about Johannesburg. I was also asked to opt in to location tracking before the site fully launched. The dates of publication are also listed within the containers with the different articles. Right above the articles, however, is a static navbar at the top, listing some of the different categories of news offered. On the homepage, you also have advertisements as well as the articles, so accidentally clicking on an ad that sends you to a new site is something I didn’t like. There are also options to play video and audio, which is a very welcome addition, I must say. 
                With this short description of the website design in mind, I can now start to look at the ethics of the design choices. The first thing I want to start by looking at is the ease of use of the site. How quickly and smoothly I can navigate usually makes or breaks my experience, regardless of the content. In “As We May Think," Vannevar Bush's ideas on association-based information retrieval resonate strongly with the discussions on UI and UX design. The emphasis on human-centric design, as articulated by the statement that “the computer should adapt itself to human needs,” underscores and emphasizes the concept of prioritizing user experience in tech-based development (Harper, 2010). In the case of the News24 website, it's easy to navigate and gives the user multiple options for finding what they’re looking for. As already mentioned, the use of categories makes finding whatever it is you are looking for way easier. Furthermore, the site doesn’t make any radical changes that would require its users to adapt to a completely new system. These include having the search bar close to the top of the screen and the use of a frozen navbar at the top of the screen. The menus also react to your interaction with them, further enhancing the user’s experience in terms of visible changes and feedback from the system. This emphasizes Harper's point on the significance of interfaces in facilitating intuitive interactions, suggesting they should fit with the users’ action capabilities (Harper, 2010). This consistency is also maintained on the other pages once you click off to different sections. The relationship between the website’s design choices and Steven Mailloux’s theory of conventions becomes evidence when considering how the UI tries to adhere to industry standards. According to the theory, conventions are the already established structure, genre, and patterns of language that govern the creation of literary texts (1983, p). The categories serve as familiar signs for users who are already on multiple news websites.

                <p>
                The most significant addition, however, is the addition of different ways of consuming the website's content. As already mentioned, the website also gives the user the option to listen to the articles or watch them through video as opposed to just reading. Providing audio and video formats alongside written articles greatly improves accessibility for users with different needs. Not all users might have the time to go about reading on their own accord, so it’s a very welcome addition. It also takes note of users with impairments or limitations, making it easier for them to consume the content while additionally improving the experience. Ensuring that the website caters to a more diverse audience is a great thing. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to test the audio and video capabilities because this requires a membership. This addition, however, also improves the engagement and retention of users, creating a more immersive and interactive experience and encouraging more exploration. In ‘You Say You Want a Revolution’, Stuart Moulthrop underscores the transformative nature of alternative content formats, aligning with his exploration of hypertext (Moulthrop, 2003, pp. 697–698). He says, “In hypertext systems, this ethos of connection is realized in techniques: users do not passively rehearse or receive discourse; they explore and construct links." This highlights the idea that users don’t just absorb information like they would with a normal physical newspaper article. They are active participants in the process that explores different connections by creating links between the various pieces of content. The content they are consuming is made more immersive and personalized. The promotion of active engagement can facilitate ethical agency among users. He argues that ‘designers must provide transparent information sharing and opportunities for participatory content creation and moderation (Moulthrop, 2003, pp. 699–700). ' This allows users to explore the information according to their preferences. 
                Now, on the next step of my critique, I would like to look at another site within the same niche and how it goes about applying the ethical principles. For this, I have picked the BBC News website, mainly because, the News24 website is already the industry standard in South Africa, so a more universal website should be used. Similar to before, I will try to ignore the actual news being displayed and focus on the design, user experience, and user interface aspects of the website, starting with the homepage. On launch, the first thing you will notice is a main article taking up the most screen real estate, accompanied by other articles taking up lesser space around it. In this case, the other articles seem to correlate with the main article here, all within the same section of the page. As you scroll down to see more articles, accompanied by thumbnails and headlines. Similar to the News24 website, you have the option to read the article but also view a video of some sort with it. In this case, however, the video footage is all put together into the same article box, instead of having the user click onto a new page that has the video articles. There’s also a live counter on most of the articles, letting the user know how many people are currently viewing the page/article they’ve clicked on. Similar to the News24 website, there’s a navigation bar right at the top of the screen, with news from different sections available to the reader. However, the navbar this time is a bit more interactive, with it shrinking down into a side menu when the screen is also made smaller. While both websites also use black, white and red are their primary colours, they seem better used on the BBC website. The red for example on the BBC website is pretty much only used to indicate to the user that a page is live, while on the News24 site, it is in use to indicate to the user what they are hovering over, and on some buttons. The font on this site is also used better, being even more consistent than before with the size. The consistency of font and color is kept even when you click off onto different pages. Once you go into your chosen article, the content is well organized right in the middle of the page and supporting images being right below the headline. The BBC website even adapts more to the users’ actions than the News24 website. I was also able to test the video and audio features here, unlike on the News24 website. The lack of advertisements is also a welcome change. The quality is of a great standard and will certainly improve the overall experience. My only main criticisms here are however the lack of engagement with other people. You can’t comment on the article you’ve read, or get more opinions on the topic. The reason perhaps could be because it’s a more worldwide website, having more languages could be more difficult to adapt to. At the same time, this is a weak reason for not adding the feature because the site automatically changes the language based on location. 
                In summary, the News24 website does well in balancing accessibility and engagement with the use of its diverse formats and intuitive design. While it isn’t quite as well done as some of its alternative contemporaries, the areas it could improve upon are minimal and could do with an even better commitment to ethical design principles with relation to its interaction design.
