              Having prior experience with GitHub made it a bit easier setting it up. Although, I had not previously been in an organization, so that was something new. 
I chose the Library of Babel reading. It’s interesting to me, as it takes place in an endless library with every possible book available. Each room contains shelves all laden with books and the sheer scale of the maze is mind-boggling. Despite this, the library remains very elusive and enigmatic, with the readers continuously searching for meaning and new truths. 
The idea of infinite possibilities, quest for meaning, navigation of chaos and the endless nature of information are some of the main topics discussed. This closely relates to the internet. With an endless amount of information at the ends of the user, it almost seems impossible to “ beat” it if that’s the correct way to put it. The internet also symbolizes the boundless potential of human knowledge, reflecting on our own high curiosity. The infinite rooms closely resembles the nearly infinite amounts of websites, blogs and forums on the web. The quest for meaning and truth, is what we all search for. In this case, I relate it to designers trying to create interfaces and interactions that guide users to relevant information.

Websites for inspiration and why –
On the design for the website. I looked at a few sites that sell products. The main reason for looking at these initially was because of the idea that there’s a product being sold, and how the site's overall structuring works to keep the viewer's interest. In my case, the product being “sold” would be the content all across the site as a whole. The site additionally just has a very pleasing design to it. 
Thus a lot of my decision making on inspiration has been on trying to focus on the functionality. 
I did 2 first sketches of wireframes. All are low quality, but my goal is to keep everything “simple” in design and have a major emphasis on the functionality and presentation of the content over the graphic aspects. I don’t want to go overboard with this idea, however, because the site might end up looking too basic. 
Moulthrop 2003 – The analysis in the text looks at the non-linear nature of hypertext, emphasizing its capacity to challenge traditional narrative structures and foster interactive engagement. Moulthrop also provides a framework for understanding the interplay between technology, storytelling, and society. The text's relevance is still enduring to this day, with the proliferation of social media, blogs, and interactive websites. These all make use of the non-linear nature of the web as underscored by Moulthrop. The democratization of content creation facilitated by the internet echoes his vision of hypertext as a platform for collective creativity and diverse voices.  There is however some difficulties and challenges that the internet evolution raises with it, the most prominent in my opinion being data collection, privacy breaches, and misinformation. This also underscores the impact of digital communication on society.

                Interaction Design 
Interaction design, in correlation to the lecture material is the craft of facilitating meaningful engagements between users and systems. More than just responsiveness, but intentional actions by users that lead to noticeable and discernible changes within the system. According to Bardin, true interaction requires visible changes that make these aforementioned changes. The actions should also not be random. The interface is a conduit for this. 
With relation to my website, the main design process involves aligning the website goals, understanding what the user needs and having all the content on the page organized well. The goal is to prioritize the user's experience by incorporating intuitive interface elements, in tern creating engaging and user-friendly sites. 
In my own progress of the site’s development, I want to look at how to incorporate more intuitive elements into the design. I plan on looking at keeping everything in terms of navigation and content presentation simple and aim for efficiency and function. All this while also keeping in mind the idea of the users’ actions having a discernible change in the system. I’ve also looked at a few more portfolio websites for the presentation of content. I believe some to be impressive, but a bit overkill for lack of better words, but take inspiration regardless

                IxD Process

Goal Alignment
-Make a portfolio website, that showcases my work using easy to navigate components . The site should place huge on function over form.

User Flow
	-The user should be able to smoothly navigate to every available page, regardless of what page they’re currently on. 

Information Structure 
	My Website 
-	Homepage: Page title and introduction to the user. Information about the website
-	Portfolio Page: Page title, about the work, detailed portfolio items 
-	Design/style : page title, different design and style sections and descisions
-	Essay : page title, essay sections
-	Blogs : Page title, blog sections, additional references.
Interface Elements 
These elements will be used all across the website to keep consistency. 
Buttons: For navigation and input 
Scroll sliders: For navigation across the page the user finds themselves on 
Links: These will allow the user to navigate between the different pages and to/from any additional websites that might link to the site because of references. 
Images: Used to illustrate certain aspects to the user

Styles
Font and Colors : I haven’t yet had a final say on what I plan on using for this. However, our main goal is function over form, so we’ll try to keep it as simple as possible, without ofcourse becoming bland. This is also a bit evident in the reference material chosen. 

While I haven’t struggled with making the website thus far, I’ve been conflicting a bit on the styling I’d like to use. Having already done this course before and failing, one thing I did previously was masking over the technical flaws using the graphics and style. While not entirely in the opposite route this time around, I want to place more emphasis on the functionality while still keeping the site aesthetically pleasing. Some of the reference material I’ve looked at has achieved this to some level, but I don’t want to just copy them in their entirety.

                Week 6 
The website I’ve looked at so far are mostly shopping sites and why I like or don’t like them ( takealot and superbalist specifically cause I always use them). 

Superbalist
An online retailer store for clothes. I chose this website specifically because it is one of the most popular and visited sites in South Africa. They house products from a very large range of brands, categories ( shoes, tops, jackets, jewellery etc). 

Design – The website for me looks alright. They haven’t used too many colors, but the colros they have complemented each other quite well. Everything from the font and images are again, just alright and consistent. There’s nothing really on there that is innovative or creating a better way for the user to navigate. 
Navigation – You can scroll through the site and click through the buttons to find whatever you’re looking for. There’s also a search bar within the navbar, and its almost always very accurate with whatever you’re looking for. To further go into giving the user options when going

Week 8 
The one that interested me the most was the article and post from the Institute for Internet Justice. They emphasize the importance of digital inclusion, especially in the 21st century, with it being an almost essential part of life, viewing it as a modern civil rights issue. Despite the availability of devices, digitalization isn’t occurring at an equal rate across the world, due to factors like pricing, low digital literacy, and infrastructure limitations.  
They went about highlighting the disparities in internet access with just under 40% of Africans having access compared to the much higher rates in other regions. In 2024 for example, the USA had 97.1% internet access for its people. The article however was during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the importance of digital technology was further underscored as being important in daily life. Not directly related to the article, this made me think about how living in a smaller city in South Africa, a lot of digital services were still not offered. 
The institute advocates for policy responses that would promote universal access to tech as a means to distribute the benefits of the information more equally. They also discussed the importance of cultural heritage in rural areas, where traditions can enrich online markets and discussions. 
Progress 
Mostly just revising some of my previous wireframes and code to make the site a bit better. Also added new content to the site. I’ve also reworked the wireframes as previously mentioned, in an attempt to add more interaction to the site. One thing I want to do is include interactive elements to the essay and blog posts. I thought of this about a virtual Wikipedia software I had used in primary school. I want to implement something similar to this. Additionally, having the website react more to the user's input, after the previous essay and using a few different websites.
