                <p itemprop="description">Ethics of website design critique</p> 

                <p>Before starting the assignment, my mind had mostly been set on using retail websites for this task. I think mainly because they’re the most commonly used websites. I strayed away from this and went with News24. According to a recently published article by MyBroadband, another prominent news website, News24, was one of the most visited websites in the 2023 calendar year, placing 10th (My Broadband, 2024). It was also, interestingly enough, one of the only local websites on there, painting an even broader picture of the dominance of external entities within the country's ecosystem. In my analysis, I will mainly focus on the design of the site adjacent to the UI and UX, scrutinizing it against industry standards and critical perspectives. Moreover, I will deliberate on the ethical implications, considering the issues within them. I will also try my best to avoid the site's main content, the news, to form an unbiased critique of this. </p>
                
                <p>As I’ve already mentioned, News24 is one of the main sources of current events regarding the ongoing events in South Africa. They’re owned by Media24 and have articles that fall within a great multitude of categories. These range from politics, sports, cultural events, and entertainment to finance, technology, and health. The first thing I did was relate this website to Jorge Borges’ Library of Babel. The quest for meaning and truth closely relates to the design process of creating interfaces that guide users to relevant information (Borges, 1941). Similarly, the News24 website aims to provide users with access to current events and stories that align with their quest for knowledge and understanding. The range of their coverage is certainly influential, making them one of the most popular sites. On launching the website, you are greeted by the homepage. The first thing I noticed were the articles. There are multiple showcases on there, all within different categories, with the most visible one, however, taking up the most real estate. I also assume that this article will be different based on your location because, in my case, it was about Johannesburg. I was also asked to opt in to location tracking before the site fully launched. The dates of publication are also listed within the containers with the different articles. Right above the articles, however, is a static navbar at the top, listing some of the different categories of news offered. On the homepage, you also have advertisements as well as the articles, so accidentally clicking on an ad that sends you to a new site is something I didn’t like. There are also options to play video and audio, which is a very welcome addition, I must say. 
                With this short description of the website design in mind, I can now start to look at the ethics of the design choices. The first thing I want to start by looking at is the ease of use of the site. How quickly and smoothly I can navigate usually makes or breaks my experience, regardless of the content. In “As We May Think," Vannevar Bush's ideas on association-based information retrieval resonate strongly with the discussions on UI and UX design. The emphasis on human-centric design, as articulated by the statement that “the computer should adapt itself to human needs,” underscores and emphasizes the concept of prioritizing user experience in tech-based development (Harper, 2010). In the case of the News24 website, it's easy to navigate and gives the user multiple options for finding what they’re looking for. As already mentioned, the use of categories makes finding whatever it is you are looking for way easier. Furthermore, the site doesn’t make any radical changes that would require its users to adapt to a completely new system. These include having the search bar close to the top of the screen and the use of a frozen navbar at the top of the screen. The menus also react to your interaction with them, further enhancing the user’s experience in terms of visible changes and feedback from the system. This emphasizes Harper's point on the significance of interfaces in facilitating intuitive interactions, suggesting they should fit with the users’ action capabilities (Harper, 2010). This consistency is also maintained on the other pages once you click off to different sections. The relationship between the website’s design choices and Steven Mailloux’s theory of conventions becomes evidence when considering how the UI tries to adhere to industry standards. According to the theory, conventions are the already established structure, genre, and patterns of language that govern the creation of literary texts (1983, p). The categories serve as familiar signs for users who are already on multiple news websites. 
                </p>

                <p>
                The most significant addition, however, is the addition of different ways of consuming the website's content. As already mentioned, the website also gives the user the option to listen to the articles or watch them through video as opposed to just reading. Providing audio and video formats alongside written articles greatly improves accessibility for users with different needs. Not all users might have the time to go about reading on their own accord, so it’s a very welcome addition. It also takes note of users with impairments or limitations, making it easier for them to consume the content while additionally improving the experience. Ensuring that the website caters to a more diverse audience is a great thing. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to test the audio and video capabilities because this requires a membership. This addition, however, also improves the engagement and retention of users, creating a more immersive and interactive experience and encouraging more exploration. In ‘You Say You Want a Revolution’, Stuart Moulthrop underscores the transformative nature of alternative content formats, aligning with his exploration of hypertext (Moulthrop, 2003, pp. 697–698). He says, “In hypertext systems, this ethos of connection is realized in techniques: users do not passively rehearse or receive discourse; they explore and construct links." This highlights the idea that users don’t just absorb information like they would with a normal physical newspaper article. They are active participants in the process that explores different connections by creating links between the various pieces of content. The content they are consuming is made more immersive and personalized. The promotion of active engagement can facilitate ethical agency among users. He argues that ‘designers must provide transparent information sharing and opportunities for participatory content creation and moderation (Moulthrop, 2003, pp. 699–700). ' This allows users to explore the information according to their preferences. 
                Now, on the next step of my critique, I would like to look at another site within the same niche and how it goes about applying the ethical principles. For this, I have picked the BBC News website, mainly because, the News24 website is already the industry standard in South Africa, so a more universal website should be used. Similar to before, I will try to ignore the actual news being displayed and focus on the design, user experience, and user interface aspects of the website, starting with the homepage. On launch, the first thing you will notice is a main article taking up the most screen real estate, accompanied by other articles taking up lesser space around it. In this case, the other articles seem to correlate with the main article here, all within the same section of the page. As you scroll down to see more articles, accompanied by thumbnails and headlines. Similar to the News24 website, you have the option to read the article but also view a video of some sort with it. In this case, however, the video footage is all put together into the same article box, instead of having the user click onto a new page that has the video articles. There’s also a live counter on most of the articles, letting the user know how many people are currently viewing the page/article they’ve clicked on. Similar to the News24 website, there’s a navigation bar right at the top of the screen, with news from different sections available to the reader. However, the navbar this time is a bit more interactive, with it shrinking down into a side menu when the screen is also made smaller. While both websites also use black, white and red are their primary colours, they seem better used on the BBC website. The red for example on the BBC website is pretty much only used to indicate to the user that a page is live, while on the News24 site, it is in use to indicate to the user what they are hovering over, and on some buttons. The font on this site is also used better, being even more consistent than before with the size. The consistency of font and color is kept even when you click off onto different pages. Once you go into your chosen article, the content is well organized right in the middle of the page and supporting images being right below the headline. The BBC website even adapts more to the users’ actions than the News24 website. I was also able to test the video and audio features here, unlike on the News24 website. The lack of advertisements is also a welcome change. The quality is of a great standard and will certainly improve the overall experience. My only main criticisms here are however the lack of engagement with other people. You can’t comment on the article you’ve read, or get more opinions on the topic. The reason perhaps could be because it’s a more worldwide website, having more languages could be more difficult to adapt to. At the same time, this is a weak reason for not adding the feature because the site automatically changes the language based on location. 
               </p>

               <p>
                In summary, the News24 website does well in balancing accessibility and engagement with the use of its diverse formats and intuitive design. While it isn’t quite as well done as some of its alternative contemporaries, the areas it could improve upon are minimal and could do with an even better commitment to ethical design principles with relation to its interaction design.

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    With the introduction of AI technologies into the tech sector, the landscape of software development is being reshaped promising both enhanced productivity and innovation. This transformation does however underscore the need to address the power dynamics present in digital colonialism and its impact on the global South. In this essay, I will be exploring the concept of digital colonialism,
                 its impact on the tech industry and developers, as well as any potential solutions for the ethical implementation of AI. </p>
                <p>
                <h3>What is Digital colonialism ?</h3>

                Firstly, I would like to start by making a working definition of the concept mainly of focus. Digital colonialism is a complex phenomenon driven by the asymmetrical power dynamics of the tech landscape. A small handful of companies hold a very huge level of power and market share within the space, in almost all regions and markets. It involves the extension of dominant superpowers, mainly
                from the USA and China, over developing and emerging countries through the expansion and introduction of new technologies, all in exchange for the new goldmine, in data and economic concessions( Verdi, 2020).What usually happens is new technologies are often introduced as a way of improving the overall infrastructure possessed by a new nation. The potential of boosting economies and productivity is highlighted and given as a great reason to adopt and not fall behind. However, this process in emerging economies only exacerbates existing inequalities, creating a scenario where only a small handful of people possess knowledge and resources needed to adopt. The pivotal role of AI in reshaping global power dynamics and economic control is highlighted(Verdi, 2020). Data exploitation is another huge thing that comes with digital colonialism. The provision of new technologies, as already touched upon, usually doesn’t come without strings(Mohamed, Png and Isaac, 2020). Countries that aren’t as wealthy, will find themselves almost bending to the will of their providers. While it seems like a friendly and equal partnership initially, the end goals are definite. The control extends beyond the aforementioned areas, to others like state surveillance, privacy and even policies being made.

                    <h3>
                        Exploitative practices by Western powers in the global South
                           </h3>

                        Digital colonialism isn’t only the continuation of historical patterns of colonial powers dominating the developing countries. It goes further into the reconstruction of power being shared using technology and data. It can similarly be understood in multiple key aspects according to Sareeta Amrute, from her keynote talk. She discusses how tech workers are often very isolated. Digital labor in the global South is often very exploitative. Workers in these regions are often willing to take very low wages. Jobs like data labeling content moderation often pay very low and fall part of the gig economy. The difference between these in the South and Global West are usually extremely vast. The job security is also non-existent. Amrute highlights this point, with the lack of physical locations and social interaction(2019). Workers are often in locations not very close to each other, and operate without any real social interaction, 
                        making their work even less recognisable as a person, but rather just another number or cog in a very large gear being spun. Amrute states that many workers work in their lonesome, further exacerbating the feeling of isolation. The very dehumanizing aspect of tech labor is highlighted here. This consequently relates directly with Google's recent layoffs of hundreds of their core employees. These positions are being moved to India and Mexico. The positions being moved and reorganized, have been key to the companies developer tools, an area that’s fundamental in streamlining with the incorporation of AI into their products(Elias, 2024). The analysis from Amrute also takes a look at the broader pattern of unequal distribution of resources and wealth. Power becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few tech giants, primarily from the North. Her point expands beyond just labor exploitation, and well into physical
                        extraction of material and digital extractions. “ The extractive nature of tech colonialism resides in the minerals that need to be mined to make the hardware for products, as well as the knowledge that comes through native pharmaceutical and technical traditions”( Amrute,2019). The exploitation of raw Earth metals and indigenous knowledge are essential components to understanding the dynamic enforcing economic dependencies. The extractive nature of contemporary technologies also applies to wider covered cases of data extraction. The extraction of raw data is treated as the materials to be processed by the tech companies( Amrute, 2019). A mirroring of historical patterns of raw resources being exploited is present in this case. A significant imbalance of wealth distribution is created in this process. This point in particular relates directly to the jobs being relocated to India and Mexico by Google.Not only unique to the case of Google however. In a lot of African countries this has always been an issue. An example being Kenyan workers employed by Sama, a company that has been contracted by OpenAI and Facebook. Ironically, they’ve described themselves as a pioneer in “ethical supply chains”, while their workers were being paid as little as $1.32 per hour for content moderation tasks that included looking through some very traumatic content(Perrigo, 2023). This was according to a report by the TIMES. The company Appen,an AI data-labeling platform,  was involved in similar practices. Oskarina Fuentes Anaya, a college student in Venezuela had signed up to earn an extra bit of money with the company through content moderation. As reported by the MIT Technology Review in a 2022 report, the various low paying jobs like image tagging often had unclear instructions and difficult payout conditions(Hao and Hernández, 2022).While they largely benefit and capitalize on cheaper labor markets, while still controlling the economic benefit. The wealth they generate remains concentrated to them, perpetuating the cycle of dependency and inequality.</p>
                
                        <p><h3></h3>
                            The next part I’d like to look at is data tracking and surveillance. Details on how data is being used is often not transparent enough. This is with relation to the user of course. In her talk, Amrute references something that relates more with the workers. She speaks about a report in which two reporters are quoted technologies used by companies to track worker safety and also tracking their every movement. This is apparently with the attempt of increasing productivity, forcing workers to work harder and for longer. The workers have no control over the data being collected as well, which gives them very little control over how their data is being used. These technologies are often also used in the remote workspace. Despite the workers not being in physical company locations, they are still being tracked by the employers with little to no control over how the data is being used. 
The patterns of digital colonialism as explained by Amrute, underscore the exploitative nature of job relocation under the guise of mass job creation in cheaper markets. They further the economic inequalities in these regions, continuing the historical colonial practices now being performed by Western conglomerates instead of the nations themselves.

                <p>
                    <h3>With the context of South Africa </h3>
                    Unfortunately, similar practices are also present in South Africa. I’ve already spoken about content moderation tasks, being pushed to users as an “easy way to work remotely” despite the work being done not paying the users fairly. The country's unique history of apartheid has left a legacy where the media and economic power are often concentrated in the hands of a few, in particular the beneficiaries from the apartheid era. This control over the narrative can often make exploitative practices appear beneficial very much integral in economic growth, masking the impacts on workers.

To even get more specific, I want to speak from the perspective of the creative industry and software development. In an article from engineerIT, by Insaaf Daniels, a director at a software company called redPanda, they provide an optimistic view on the implementation of AI into software development in South Africa, emphasizing the potential for human creativity to strive, while the AI in itself helps streamline the coding and development(Daniels, 2024). The case of AI being a tool to improve productivity and skills is emphasized and mentioned, however doesn’t mention some of the implications that could come with this. For one, it doesn’t mention the data it could be trained on and it biases, but most importantly a wider impact on employment. They touch upon the impact on employment, stating that it won’t be used as a way to replace developers. They don’t speak about the potential displacement of traditional software dev jobs.This could exacerbate the current economic inequalities and already quite exploitative labor market in the country. In the context of Amrute’s views on the extractive nature of techno colonialism, this very optimistic portrayal of AI implementation overlooks the exploitative nature of its integration(Amrute, 2024).There is other examples of similar business practices at play in South Africa, but fortunately there hasn’t been mass 

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>Where does this leave me ?</h3>
                    Where does this leave me and other developers in South Africa? In a labor market already rife with exploitation, it is somewhat difficult to see actual positives. I personally have mostly been of the view that any tool that makes creative work more fun, by assisting in the “heavy lifting” is mostly welcome. AI models should in particular be used as tools to assist in completing one's job. They can improve productivity and efficiency. At the same time, improved productivity is used as an excuse for more work hours while pay remaining on the low is a worry. The biggest worry on my part is creativity being hurt. Over reliance on AI is leading to situations where developers are no longer challenging their own level of critical thinking to come up with innovative solutions to problems, leading to skill atrophy. The goal in this example is at least for the developer to come up with lets say 70% of the work, while the rest could be trying to find alternatives to what they’ve done. In my opinion this is a better approach. Another worry I have is the usage of AI to ultimately replace skillful devs. More ethical development should be advocated for the use of diverse and inclusive datasets in order to avoid biases. The tools should be used as I’ve mentioned many times already, to augment human creativity rather than replace it entirely. Stronger regulations and policies could be built to help ensure fair labor practices. Public awareness on how the tool can be better used to actually improve employees' work. This should be done with the most transparency as possible. This aligns with Amrutes view, that ethical use of technologies is vital in preventing techno colonial exploitation.

                    In summary, the historical patterns of colonialism within the tech sector and AI usage continue to perpetuate inequalities and exploitation. With the correct integration however, AI could be ethically used to help mitigate the aforementioned issues. This aligns with the vision for a decolonized future where technology's main purpose is empowerment.
