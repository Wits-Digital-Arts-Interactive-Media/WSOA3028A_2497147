                    <h1>Week 1: Introduction and The Library of Babel</h1>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>Having prior experience with GitHub made it a bit easier setting it up. Although, I had not previously been in an organization, so that was something new.</p>
                    <p>I chose the Library of Babel reading. It’s interesting to me, as it takes place in an endless library with every possible book available. Each room contains shelves all laden with books and the sheer scale of the maze is mind-boggling. Despite this, the library remains very elusive and enigmatic, with the readers continuously searching for meaning and new truths.</p>
                    <p>The idea of infinite possibilities, quest for meaning, navigation of chaos, and the endless nature of information are some of the main topics discussed. This closely relates to the internet. With an endless amount of information at the ends of the user, it almost seems impossible to “beat” it if that’s the correct way to put it. The internet also symbolizes the boundless potential of human knowledge, reflecting on our own high curiosity. The infinite rooms closely resemble the nearly infinite amounts of websites, blogs, and forums on the web. The quest for meaning and truth, is what we all search for. In this case, I relate it to designers trying to create interfaces and interactions that guide users to relevant information.</p>

                    <h1>Week 2: Design Inspiration and Initial Sketches</h1>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>Websites for inspiration and why – On the design for the website. I looked at a few sites that sell products. The main reason for looking at these initially was because of the idea that there’s a product being sold, and how the site's overall structuring works to keep the viewer's interest. In my case, the product being “sold” would be the content all across the site as a whole. The site additionally just has a very pleasing design to it.</p>
                    <p>Thus a lot of my decision making on inspiration has been on trying to focus on the functionality. I did 2 first sketches of wireframes. All are low quality, but my goal is to keep everything “simple” in design and have a major emphasis on the functionality and presentation of the content over the graphic aspects. I don’t want to go overboard with this idea, however, because the site might end up looking too basic.</p>
                    <p>Moulthrop 2003 – The analysis in the text looks at the non-linear nature of hypertext, emphasizing its capacity to challenge traditional narrative structures and foster interactive engagement. Moulthrop also provides a framework for understanding the interplay between technology, storytelling, and society. The text's relevance is still enduring to this day, with the proliferation of social media, blogs, and interactive websites. These all make use of the non-linear nature of the web as underscored by Moulthrop. The democratization of content creation facilitated by the internet echoes his vision of hypertext as a platform for collective creativity and diverse voices. There is however some difficulties and challenges that the internet evolution raises with it, the most prominent in my opinion being data collection, privacy breaches, and misinformation. This also underscores the impact of digital communication on society.</p>

                    <h1>Week 3: Interaction Design</h1>
                </header>
                <section>
                    <p>Interaction design, in correlation to the lecture material, is the craft of facilitating meaningful engagements between users and systems. More than just responsiveness, but intentional actions by users that lead to noticeable and discernible changes within the system. According to Bardin, true interaction requires visible changes that make these aforementioned changes. The actions should also not be random. The interface is a conduit for this.</p>
                    <p>With relation to my website, the main design process involves aligning the website goals, understanding what the user needs and having all the content on the page organized well. The goal is to prioritize the user's experience by incorporating intuitive interface elements, in turn creating engaging and user-friendly sites.</p>
                    <p>In my own progress of the site’s development, I want to look at how to incorporate more intuitive elements into the design. I plan on looking at keeping everything in terms of navigation and content presentation simple and aim for efficiency and function. All this while also keeping in mind the idea of the users’ actions having a discernible change in the system. I’ve also looked at a few more portfolio websites for the presentation of content. I believe some to be impressive, but a bit overkill for lack of better words, but take inspiration regardless.</p>

                <p>Goal Alignment - Make a portfolio website, that showcases my work using easy to navigate components. The site should prioritize function over form.</p>
                
                <p>User Flow - The user should be able to smoothly navigate to every available page, regardless of what page they’re currently on.</p>
                
                <p>Information Structure - My Website 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Homepage: Page title and introduction to the user. Information about the website</li>
                        <li>Portfolio Page: Page title, about the work, detailed portfolio items</li>
                        <li>Design/style: Page title, different design and style sections and decisions</li>
                        <li>Essay: Page title, essay sections</li>
                        <li>Blogs: Page title, blog sections, additional references</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>Interface Elements - These elements will be used all across the website to maintain consistency:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buttons: For navigation and input</li>
                        <li>Scroll sliders: For navigation across the page the user finds themselves on</li>
                        <li>Links: These will allow the user to navigate between the different pages and to/from any additional websites that might link to the site because of references</li>
                        <li>Images: Used to illustrate certain aspects to the user</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>Styles - Font and Colors: I haven’t yet finalized what I plan on using for this. However, our main goal is function over form, so we’ll try to keep it as simple as possible, without of course becoming bland. This is also evident in the reference material chosen.
                </p>
                
                <p>While I haven’t struggled with making the website thus far, I’ve been conflicting a bit on the styling I’d like to use. Having already done this course before and failing, one thing I did previously was masking over the technical flaws using graphics and style. While not entirely in the opposite route this time around, I want to place more emphasis on functionality while still keeping the site aesthetically pleasing. Some of the reference material I’ve looked at has achieved this to some level, but I don’t want to just copy them in their entirety.

                            <p>The website I’ve looked at so far are mostly shopping sites and why I like or don’t like them ( takealot and superbalist specifically cause I always use them). 
                            </p>
                            <p><h3>Superbalist</h3>
                            An online retailer store for clothes. I chose this website specifically because it is one of the most popular and visited sites in South Africa. They house products from a very large range of brands, categories ( shoes, tops, jackets, jewellery etc). 
                            </p>
                            <p>Design – The website for me looks alright. They haven’t used too many colors, but the colros they have complemented each other quite well. Everything from the font and images are again, just alright and consistent. There’s nothing really on there that is innovative or creating a better way for the user to navigate. 
                            Navigation – You can scroll through the site and click through the buttons to find whatever you’re looking for. There’s also a search bar within the navbar, and its almost always very accurate with whatever you’re looking for. To further go into giving the user options when going

               <h3>Reflection</h3> 
                    <p>The one that interested me the most was the article and post from the Institute for Internet Justice. They emphasize the importance of digital inclusion, especially in the 21st century, with it being an almost essential part of life, viewing it as a modern civil rights issue. Despite the availability of devices, digitalization isn’t occurring at an equal rate across the world, due to factors like pricing, low digital literacy, and infrastructure limitations.  
                        They went about highlighting the disparities in internet access with just under 40% of Africans having access compared to the much higher rates in other regions. In 2024 for example, the USA had 97.1% internet access for its people. The article however was during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the importance of digital technology was further underscored as being important in daily life. Not directly related to the article, this made me think about how living in a smaller city in South Africa, a lot of digital services were still not offered. 
                        The institute advocates for policy responses that would promote universal access to tech as a means to distribute the benefits of the information more equally. They also discussed the importance of cultural heritage in rural areas, where traditions can enrich online markets and discussions. 
                    </p>
                    <p><h4>Progress </h4>
                    Mostly just revising some of my previous wireframes and code to make the site a bit better. Also added new content to the site. I’ve also reworked the wireframes as previously mentioned, in an attempt to add more interaction to the site. One thing I want to do is include interactive elements to the essay and blog posts. I thought of this about a virtual Wikipedia software I had used in primary school. I want to implement something similar to this. Additionally, having the website react more to the user's input, after the previous essay and using a few different websites.

                   <h3> Towards a Study of Information Geographies</h3>
                    The article looked at the differences between geography and information. Through analysing the geographies, the authors were able to shed light on the disparities in connectivity and content creation across different regions. This point is emphasized by stating, “ there are few signs that global informational peripheries are achieving comparable levels of participation or representation with traditional information cores, despite the hopes of policy makers”. The differences mentioned include :
                    </p>
                    <p> <h4>1 Broadband Access Costs </h4>
                    In North America and Europe , the absolute costs are higher because of trade and currency power, the relative costs are far lower, making it more affordable for the average worker. In many parts of Africa, the cost is closer to 10% to 250% of average income. This makes it far more prohibitive for most post-people. To put this a bit more into perspective, the monthly costs of uncapped Fibre in South Africa and the UK were close, however the infrastructure is way older and common in the later country, making it cheaper for higher download speeds. This trend becomes even worse for other African countries. 
                </p>
                <p><h4> 2 Content Production Disparities</h4>
                    The article also mentions the disparities in content creation overall between the global North and South. A few different world maps are used to visualize the difference in participation across different platforms. My main focus was on South Africa, Eastern Europe and North America. While South Africa is still contributing more compared to other African countries, they’re still significantly behind the North Americans and Europeans. The article also points out the unequal distribution of resources,  noting that "the global North producing, and being the subject of, exponentially more content than the global South.” This directly relates to the lack of infrastructure as well. 
                    In summary, despite the spread of internet access, the inequalities between regions persist. This could serve as a very important point on the start point for further research into underlying causes and nuances of these disparities. 
                    Internet for Internet Just Society-Internet Access is a Fundamental Right. Especially, amidst a Pandemic
                </p>   
                <p>
                    The article argued that internet access should be considered a fundamental human right, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. It also highlights how this was further exacerbated, with the majority of people without access unable to participate in the digital economy or essential services like education over the news and so on. People in certain areas of the country for example, weren’t offered any delivery services for essentials. This raises the question of what role the government plays in ensuring internet access

              <h3>  The Case for the Industrial Revolultion and South Africa </h3>
                <p> 
                The section centers on the inability of the South African government to carry out successful industrial reform, specifically with regard to the automotive sector. It draws attention to the dangers associated with the 4IR, which include decreased job creation and the need for highly skilled labor—a shortage that South Africa has because of its subpar educational system. The discussion surrounding industrial automation highlights the dual nature of the threat it poses: while highly skilled workers may find opportunities in new 4IR industries, potentially unqualified workers could lose their jobs. But South Africa's employment rates might suffer from the shift to services if the country doesn't have a strong industrial base. Manufacturing processes are being revolutionized by the ability to produce complex and customized goods, which is made possible by advancements in robotics and software. The European Commission suggests measures to improve economic recovery and competitiveness, but

               <h4> Further development of website.</h4> This week, I've already mostly intergrated the javascript changes i wanted, so more of my time went towards trying to make sure the styling will work with the changes I've made. Making adjustments to the wireframes and styling is what I've been busy with. However, i haven't gotten every single feature to work 100%, because they require both the Css and Javascript to work together.

               <h3> Changes to incoperate JS</h3>
                The changes I made were to increase the functionality. I want to use cards, slideshows and other similar items for content displaying. I also want to incorporate features that would keep my design overall very simple and functional, without hurting the performance. But additionally, one important thing is making the user work a bit less as they try and explore the page. So I want to try and include features that could help go through the blogs, essay or design sections for example with ease, without having to do too much work. 
                This will ofcourse help in streamlining the site and user experience. 
                <h3>    Digital Colonialities</h3>
               <br> Reflection 
                I read through the ‘The Road to Technocolonialism’ text. Verdi’s analysis underscores the geopolitical implications of AI, highlighting the dominance of a Sino-American duopoly in AI technology and its potential to reshape global power dynamics. He outlines a scenario where developing countries, lacking the infrastructure to develop their own AI systems, become reliant on the US and China for access to AI technology, inadvertently surrendering political and economic control in exchange. Verdi warns of the risks of techno-colonialism, where centralized control of technology is used to exert dominance over other nations, reminiscent of historical colonial practices.
                Building on this, the idea of digital colonialism goes beyond just AI, also going broader into the internet and technology in general. Mignolo and Walsh also give a perspective on the concept, on how the asymmetrical power dynamics inherent in technologies perpetuate and uphold the legacies. The examples of economic dependency on Western and Asian giants to exert control over ecosystems echoes the historical patterns of colonial exploitation.

             <h3>   Responsive Design </h3>

                The CSS I've made thus far is just about adding all of the styling elements planned to the website. Ofcourse, the relationship between the 3, is that of a house, with html being the blueprint, css the interior design and styling, and the javascript being plumbing and lighting to add functionality.
                Now the next thing at hand is responsive design. This is a design principle that encompasses the UX and UI, in the design adapting to the user based on their needs.
                The design should adjust itself to improve upon its functionality. The concept wants to incorporate ethical design practices within the design as previosly mentioned with the end goal being to improve functionality and usability. 
             <br>   
                Some benefits are future proofing the design, so it can be used with more devices in the future. This also means, the designer can get ahead on adopting new feature
                to the design. It also overall improves SEO and cost efficiency. The challenges that the designer might come across are complexity of implementation. Making a more accessible 
                product is always difficult, because flexibility does increase cost and design time. This could also heavily impact performance.

                <h3>   Site Development </h3>

                A lot of the styling I had for the initial plans for the website required the Javascript to work simultaneously. So now the goal is to implement all of these styling and functionality features.

                <p><h3> Values at Play - Design Tradeoffs in socially-orientated environments</h3>

                
                The paper takes a comprehensive overview of the complexities involved with integrating values into design process. In particular, with social-oriented game design. By presenting practical strageties and systematic methodology, insight into ways to navigate the landscape of technology design is given. They mention that the approach taken isn’t meant to be a total replacement of the existing and well-established design methodologies, but rather to demonstrate examples of the attention to the value existing in many design processes(p752). The emphasis on reflective practice serve as an example of how this could lead to success. Regarding the Repunsel project, the reframing of the design question from “ how to teach programming to girls” to “ how to create a compelling environment in which programming is a central element “ was used(p.754). An example of reflective practice at play. 
                In the context of web-design, this practice can still be used successfully. Designers can prioritize these values by reflecting on the impact of design decisions on users and society. For example, instead of using dark patterns that trick the user into making certain actions, you could just let them have more autonomy in their actions. Another way, is being transparent with the decision making at play. Perhaps letting them know how we plan on using the data we’re collecting from them.

               <p><h3>The internet as a moral space: The Legacy of Roger Silverstone</h3>

                In reflecting on the text, there are several key points that stand out regarding the internets role within the broader media environment. First, Orgad emphasizes the importance of understanding the internet as part of a larger media ecosystem. This aligns with Silverstone’s view that the internet is the main provider of the connection and disconnection vital in our relationships. This connection also suggests that the internet shouldn’t be studied just as a single entity, but with context of the other components that are being influenced and influencing other media forms. The concept of “proper distance” is also seen as a crucial aspect in rethinking the ethical implications of internet communication, involving the degree of distance and proximity needed in the relationships to foster care, responsibility and understanding ( Orgad, 2007, p.35). The focus on reciprocity in online interactions is challenged, also urging and trying to influence a change towards unconditional car for the other( Orgad, 2007,p. 39). 
             <h4>  What this means to me </h4>
                
                For me, the perspective given is one that tries to emphasize the need for rethinking how we design and operate on the internet. This should be more human and ethical in practice. The internet should be used a bit less as a tool for spreading and acquiring information, but also a a space where ethical and moral decisions are of importance. This requires us to have a bigger priority on human based design( ergonomics per say), and for the human element in digital interactions to be prioritized. 
                <h4>   What this would look like ?</h4>
                This would mean we design and use website that prioritize the users well-being and ethical standards. Implementing certain features that could mean the user leaves even more satisfied not just because they acquired content or interaction, but also from the experience they have on the site as a whole. Some other sites could focus on higher accessibility to provide equal learning opportunities for all users. 
                
                <h4>  What are the Challenges we Face?</h4>
                Several challenges ofcourse will arise in making the internet a more moral and safer space. The first one is balancing how quick we adopt new technologies. Wanting to adopt something new for the sake of better SEO or being able to simply say this feature is present on the site, could be counterproductive in giving enough time to adapt and develop new ethical guidelines. Another challenge, that comes with increased accessibility is catering to diverse groups. What might be considered ethical with one group, might not be with the other for example, so finding this balance will be very difficult. Regardless being able to accomplish this is a great achievement for anyone.

              <h3> Further Development on the Site </h3> 
                
                At this point in time, my focus is on getting the site to the final state of this current plan. I have to fix mistakes that I didn’t quite consider previously, like making the site even easier to use. The design thus far is fairly simple. I’ve done this in the attempt for it to be able to have abit more increased accessibility, but I hadn’t considered making it easier for the user. Implementing features like buttons for easier scrolling, perhaps search tools or even a help box. But currently, I’m facing challenges implementing some of the additional javascript features, so I might have to downscale some of that compared to the original designs.

                    <h2>API</h2>
            
                 
                        <h3>What They Are?</h3>
                        <p>In the context of web development, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information seamlessly.</p>
                   
            
                   
                        <h3>What They Do?</h3>
                        <p>APIs play an important role in enhancing our site's functionality by enabling interaction with external services. Examples include payment gateways for e-commerce, music streaming services, data providers, and social media platforms. They add functionality that is already defined on well-known servers. We can still practice ethical internet use with them by ensuring data privacy, secure connections, and transparent user consent when handling their personal information.</p>
                        <p>This is pretty much the best way I could link my work for the portfolio section of the website, because right now, I'm mostly using images instead of videos as well.</p>
                    
            </P>
                    <p>Continuing updates to my site, I've gone through with most of the previous CSS, but now it's just about fixing any of the issues I had in the previous submission. Most are down to not really double-checking and bug testing my work.</p>
