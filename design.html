            <br>Font and Colors : I haven’t yet had a final say on what I plan on using for this. However, our main goal is function over form, so we’ll try to keep it as simple as possible, without ofcourse becoming bland. This is also a bit evident in the reference material chosen. 

            <br>Updated 

            Font and Colors : Roboto, san-sarif as chose fonts. Colors to be used will be grey for the background, white and red for the fonts.

                <h1>Reference Websites</h1>
               
               
                <a href="https://www.porsche.com/middle-east/_southafrica_/">Visit Porsche Website</a>
                   I chose the Porsche website because of its use of black and white. The site also has a section on the homepage where different interactive sections from other pages are previewed. I want to try and incoporate this in my site as well.                              
               
                
               <a href="Camillemormal.com, camillemormal.com/">Camille Normal Portfolio site</a>
                    This for me is one of the best portfolio sites I've come across. The way the user navigates through the site was extremely inovative while interesting. It looks simple as well, without being completely static and bland.
